# Redux Freeform

Redux Freeform is a library that allows the abstraction of form based state
management tasks in [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). The goal of Freeform is to be
solely concerned with state management and be completely independent from the render
or view part of your frontend app.

Freeform can handle these common tasks for you:

- data validation
- tracking dirty fields
- updating fields
- tracking multiple error states
